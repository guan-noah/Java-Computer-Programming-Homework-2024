Program #9

The programs gets input (inches) from the user then converts it to feet, yards and 
centimeter units.

Working on: This will have a field variable, parameter(s) passed to a method, 
methods that return a value (not void).

Testing:
Any integer number greater than 0 should work.
Ex:	100 inches = 8.33 feet = 2.78 yards = 254.00 centimeters, 
 23.4 inches throws an error as it is not an integer. 
 any character throws an error
 24 inches = 2.00 feet = 0.67 yards = 60.96 centimeters

/*
 * New to UnitConverter3 - it creates an instance of this class and uses it to 
 * call its own methods. This will allow us to get rid of static. There's only one 
 * class. The only thing main will do now is call a method that actually 
 * calls everything else.

 * This is like the CEO telling his underling to get the job done.
