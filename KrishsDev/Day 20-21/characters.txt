An arbiter of chaos, The Cubic is quite unpredictable compared to its lower degree counterparts. Its irregular flips and turns provide a factor of uncertainty in its moves, giving it incredible potential, but also the chance to backfire.

The Circle is the perfect cannon fodder for the Polygon Empire. Being non-polygons themselves, many polygons believed that circles were inferior, thus leading to their mass-conscription into the war. Circles yearn for the day they re-achieve autonomy, and efforts such as the 360th Rebellion have been made to secure their freedom.
