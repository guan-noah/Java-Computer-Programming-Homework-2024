SummerVacation.java
Describes what I did over the summer
Our second project! 
*/

/*
Instructions: Write SummerVacation.java, which will: 
	Print out sentences and lists about what you did this summer. 
	Follow the format of the example given. Include a minimum of 6 lines, not counting blank lines. 
	Use methods print(), println(), and escape sequences for tab, new line, and quotes. The 3 blank lines do not count for the escape sequence for new lines. 
	Using print with the 3 blank lines does not count and is bad. 
	Use print and a println statement to write 2 things on the same line in the terminal window. 
	Do not use lots of spaces to place your words appropriately. 
	Be a one-method (main) and one-class program. 
	Have skipped lines and indentation to make your program easy to read.
